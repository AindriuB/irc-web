# Plan

What is open, in priority order. Only `scribe` edits this file.

Each item: one line of what, one line of why it matters, and its blocker if it
has one. When an item is in flight, mark it with its task ids. Delete items you
no longer want rather than letting them rot — a plan nobody trusts is worse
than no plan.

## Now

### Merge the remaining dependabot pull requests
Seven are green (#1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8) — CI actions and base images. The
Spring Boot 4 migration landed in #9.
**Blocked by:** needs a human to merge.

## Next

### Persist the backlog
Session history is in memory, capped at 500 messages, and a restart loses it
along with the connections. Needs an H2 table, a retention policy, and a
decision about private messages sitting on disk — the stored IRC passwords are
encrypted at rest and message history arguably should be too.

### More than one network at once
A session is keyed by account, so connecting to a second network is refused.
Lifting that needs a window that can show several, not just a registry change.

## Someday

### Attach a real IRC client
A listener port so HexChat, irssi or a phone client can attach to the same
session alongside the browser — a ZNC replacement rather than a web client with
a bouncer behind it. Means implementing the server half of IRC, authenticating
clients, replaying state to each, and fanning traffic both ways. Largest of
these by far, and it opens a credentialed port.
